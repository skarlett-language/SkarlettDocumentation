#
While loops:
  - require a condition
  - the statement must be wrapped around with curly brackets
  - the "exit" keyword interrupts the execution of the loop
  - the "continue" keyword skips the execution flow to the next condition check
#

i = 0
while i < 10 {
    if i == 6 {
        continue
    }
    show(i)
    if i == 8 {
        exit
    }
    i -= 1
